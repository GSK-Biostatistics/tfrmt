# big Ns constant by page

    Code
      auto <- apply_tfrmt(.data = data, tfrmt = mytfrmt, mock = FALSE)
    Message
      Mismatch between big Ns and page_plan. For varying big N's by page (`by_page` = TRUE in `big_n_structure`), data must contain 1 big N value per unique grouping variable/value set to ".default" in `page_plan` and bigNs must be in order of the data

page_plan(
  ...,
  note_loc = c("noprint", "preheader", "source_note"),

\arguments{
\item{...}{a series of \code{\link[=page_structure]{page_structure()}} separated by commas}

\item{note_loc}{Location of the note describing each table's subset value(s).
Useful if the \code{page_structure} contains only ".default" values (meaning the
table is split by every unique level of a grouping variable), and that
variable is dropped in the col_plan. \code{preheader} only available for rtf output.}

\item{row_every_n}{Option to split at every \emph{n} number of rows, consistent
with gt::gt_split(). Takes a numeric value.}

\description{
Defining the location and/or frequency of page splits with a series of
page_structure's and the row_every_n argument, respectively.

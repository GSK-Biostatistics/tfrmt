element_row_grp_loc(
  location = c("indented", "spanning", "column", "noprint"),
  indent = "  "
)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{Location of the row group labels. Specifying 'indented'
combines all group and label variables into a single column with each
sub-group indented under its parent. 'spanning' and 'column' retain the
highest level group variable in its own column and combine all remaining
group and label variables into a single column with sub-groups indented. The
highest level group column will either be printed as a spanning header or in
its own column in the gt. Finally, the 'noprint' option allows the user to
suppress group values from being printed.}

\item{indent}{A string of the number of spaces you want to indent}

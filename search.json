Reordering multiple column variables simplest lowest level column variable contains unique values (.e., 1 value per column final table), like example . , isn’t always case take following example: table want ensure \"Treatment\" always \"Placebo\" \"mean\" comes \"sd\". can make one span_structure specifies order span level order my_col level. examples col_plan see examples unusual table vignettes.","code":"dat <- tibble::tribble(   ~group , ~label      , ~span2        , ~span1     , ~my_col  , ~parm   , ~val ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel1\" , \"column cols\" , \"cols 1,2\" , \"col1\"   , \"value\" ,    1 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel1\" , \"column cols\" , \"cols 1,2\" , \"col2\"   , \"value\" ,    1 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel1\" , NA            , NA         , \"mycol3\" , \"value\" ,    1 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel1\" , \"column cols\" , \"col 4\"    , \"col4\"   , \"value\" ,    1 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel1\" , NA            , NA         , \"mycol5\" , \"value\" ,    1 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel2\" , \"column cols\" , \"cols 1,2\" , \"col1\"   , \"value\" ,    2 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel2\" , \"column cols\" , \"cols 1,2\" , \"col2\"   , \"value\" ,    2 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel2\" , NA            , NA         , \"mycol3\" , \"value\" ,    2 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel2\" , \"column cols\" , \"col 4\"    , \"col4\"   , \"value\" ,    2 ,   \"g1\"   , \"rowlabel2\" , NA            , NA         , \"mycol5\" , \"value\" ,    2 ,   \"g2\"   , \"rowlabel3\" , \"column cols\" , \"cols 1,2\" , \"col1\"   , \"value\" ,    3 ,   \"g2\"   , \"rowlabel3\" , \"column cols\" , \"cols 1,2\" , \"col2\"   , \"value\" ,    3 ,   \"g2\"   , \"rowlabel3\" , NA            , NA         , \"mycol3\" , \"value\" ,    3 ,   \"g2\"   , \"rowlabel3\" , \"column cols\" , \"col 4\"    , \"col4\"   , \"value\" ,    3 ,   \"g2\"   , \"rowlabel3\" , NA            , NA         , \"mycol5\" , \"value\" ,    3 , ) tfrmt(   group = group,   label = label,   param = parm,   value = val,   # specify spanner columns and unique column from data   column = c(span2, span1, my_col),   body_plan = body_plan(     frmt_structure(group_val = \".default\", label_val = \".default\", frmt(\"x\"))   ),   col_plan = col_plan(     group,     label,     starts_with(\"col\"),     new_col_3 = mycol3,     -mycol5   ) ) |>   print_to_gt(dat) tfrmt(   group = group,   label = label,   param = parm,   value = val,   column = c(span2, span1, my_col),   body_plan = body_plan(     frmt_structure(group_val = \".default\", label_val = \".default\", frmt(\"x\"))   ),   col_plan = col_plan(     # rename column spanner in same level     span_structure(       span1 = c(         \"first cols\" = \"cols 1,2\",         \"just col4\" = \"col 4\"       )     ),     # rename column spanner in different level     span_structure(span2 = c(\"most columns\" = \"column cols\")),     group,     label,     starts_with(\"col\"),     new_col_3 = mycol3,     -mycol5   ) ) |>   print_to_gt(dat) tfrmt(   group = group,   label = label,   param = parm,   value = val,   column = c(span2, span1, my_col),   body_plan = body_plan(     frmt_structure(group_val = \".default\", label_val = \".default\", frmt(\"x\"))   ),   col_plan = col_plan(     group,     label,     # reordering spanners     span_structure(span1 = c(\"col 4\")),     span_structure(span1 = c(\"cols 1,2\"), my_col = c(\"col2\", \"col1\")),     everything(),     new_col_3 = mycol3,     -mycol5   ) ) |>   print_to_gt(dat) dat <- tibble::tribble(   ~group , ~label  , ~span       , ~my_col , ~parm  , ~val  ,   \"g1\"   , \"stats\" , \"Placebo\"   , \"sd\"    , \"sd\"   , 1.435 ,   \"g1\"   , \"stats\" , \"Placebo\"   , \"mean\"  , \"mean\" , 2.843 ,   \"g1\"   , \"stats\" , \"Treatment\" , \"mean\"  , \"mean\" , 1.234 ,   \"g1\"   , \"stats\" , \"Treatment\" , \"sd\"    , \"sd\"   , 2.123 , ) tfrmt(   group = group,   label = label,   param = parm,   value = val,   column = c(span, my_col),   body_plan = body_plan(     frmt_structure(group_val = \".default\", label_val = \".default\", frmt(\"x.xx\"))   ),   col_plan = col_plan(     group,     label,     span_structure(       span = c(\"Treatment\", \"Placebo\"),       my_col = c(\"mean\", \"sd\")     )   ) ) |>   print_to_gt(dat)"},{"path":"https://gsk-biostatistics.github.io/tfrmt/articles/col_style_plan.html","id":"style-structure","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Style Structure","title":"Column Style Plan","text":"col_style_structure four arguments: columns final table aligned, alignment desired, alignment type, widths apply columns. col_style_structure requires least one alignment width defined.

Finally param column, value column additional grouping column, grp, can use complex formatting. mock going match looks like : table, three columns treatment groups, total column groups combined, p-value column. table also contains mix categorical continuous analysis. first thing going building tfrmt specify columns makes table, isn’t nice table definitely doesn’t match mock. let’s start formatting numbers. going build body_plan add tfrmt. fairly quick explanation body_plans like information see vignettes(\"Body Plan\") Body plans made series frmt_stuctures frmt_stucture represents formatting cell within table. order frmt_structures matter; always applied latest oldest. means first frmt_stucture body_plan generic. can use groups, labels parameters specify formatting applies values. start, going use rows “n (%)” default. way don’t need list every row “n (%)” row. rows made two different values, need use frmt_combine. Next, can format continuous variables, just straightforward one value per row can just use label filter frmt define look. Finally, want format p-values. bit complicated, since p-value sits row parameters; therefore group label value specific enough need something granular. , need specify parameter frmt_structure like : frmt_structure(group_val = \".default\", label_val = \".default\", p = frmt(\"x.xx\"). , also need make sure never displays rounded p-value 0 1. can use frmt_when specify formatting based value. Now numbers look correct, can drop order columns grp column (note want display grp column, plays role behind scenes, addressed next step). use col_plan uses tidy-select nomenclature drop/move columns. Now table looks just right. two problems, (1) alignment (2) spacing continuous categorical values. take care alignment going add col_style_plan accepts series col_style_structures. allows columns aligned differently needed. table, want columns align either “.”, “,” ” ” col_style_structure looks like col_style_structure(align = c(\".\",\",\",\" \"), col = vars(everything())). alignment sorted can move spacing. order match spacing mock need use extra grp column data. look data, can see want space time either groups change. means can use row_grp_plan just \".default\" group value handle spacing. addition spacing, row_grp_plan let us move spanning group labels separate column changing label_loc “column”.","code":"#> #

Multiple treatment groups well contrasts groups included. NOTE: Pay attention label data_efficacy must matching label_val label_val frmt_combine() work. example, Mean (SD), variable different param (mean sd respectively), label (Mean (SD)). mock going match looks like : Let’s first see table looks without special formatting. judicious use body_plan’s frmt, frmt_combine, frmt_when, can conditionally format different pieces results. summary statistics, number observations (n), mean standard deviation (mean, sd), median range (median, min, max). models, p-value (p.value) least squares mean difference (diff) well associated standard error (diff_se) 95% confidence interval (diff_lcl, diff_ucl). label column indicates row various measures belong . First, let’s format stand-alone values: n p-value. Notice n always sits row labelled “n”; therefore can reference label_val param name frmt_structure. p-values several different label values convenient format according param name frmt_structure. Next, remaining param values combined twos threes. Therefore, use frmt_combine utility achieve desired formatting: Now values formatted correctly, can make sure table sorted appropriately passing order columns sorting_cols. can also drop order columns final display using col_plan. Notice row labels quite right. First, bit hierarchy label values nested group values, nice add indentation make nesting obvious. Also, cases, group values also contain summary data, means ARD contains matching group label value. summary rows, want suppress printing extra group-level header, display summary data -line. row_grp_plan can help us via row_grp_loc argument: Almost done! Notice spec also contains empty rows different groups data. can mimic behavior passing row_grp_structure objects row_grp_plan. objects define “blocks” rows describe format . case, want add post space specific blocks data. can reference locations block based values group variable. , efficacy table complete!","code":"#> #
